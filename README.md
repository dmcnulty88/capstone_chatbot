## Abstract
The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years has been propelled by the development of generative AI applications from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. IBM characterizes a chatbot as a computer program simulating human conversation, with contemporary iterations increasingly integrating conversational AI techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP). These chatbots can be utilized across diverse domains, including applications in home speakers, messenger apps, and virtual assistants. An essential factor in the progression of modern AI chatbots is the application of transformer models, exemplified by architectures like GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3). These models play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of conversational agents, especially through the attention mechanism, which effectively captures contextual information, contributing to more coherent and context-aware responses. This work is dedicated to leveraging the capabilities of large language models for the development of a multitasking AI chatbot that is adept at handling both voice and text commands. We implement various functionalities such as listening to users, engaging in naturalistic conversations, conducting online searches, providing maps or directions for navigational purposes, and playing music, among others. Beyond these advanced features, the chatbot boasts bilingual proficiency, enabling it to understand and respond in both English and Spanish. This bilingual capability significantly enhances the chatbot’s accessibility and usability, catering to a broader user base. Ultimately, we intend to define the chatbot’s desired capabilities and fine-tune existing language models to achieve the intended results.
